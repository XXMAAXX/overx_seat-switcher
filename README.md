# overx_seat-switcher - 1.1.1x
This is a very simple client-side script that is a modern version of the "[Disable Seat Shuffling](https://discord.gg/MeU4xjPsWU)" plugin by _callmejaf_.

This release fixes some of the most common bugs with it, such as:
- The seat shuffle animation no longer loops / does partial animations
- Door closing animation works properly now
